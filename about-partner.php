                    <p>Dr. Dowdy is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology, practicing general internist, leader in the field of TB and TB/HIV modeling, and Director of the Johns Hopkins Tuberculosis Modeling Group. His expertise combines operational/implementation research, epidemiology, health economics, and mathematical modeling.  He has published >75 peer-reviewed manuscripts, constructed >10 economic models of interventions to fight TB and TB/HIV and has interests in constructing models that account for local distribution of disease, as well as user-friendly models that can be accessed by public health decision-makers.  He , won the International Union Against TB and Lung Diseaseâ€™s Young Investigator Award in 2012 and leads twice-monthly conference calls (>100 group members) that highlight the importance of linkages between TB modelers and public health practitioners (podcasts available at modeltb.org), which include participants from the CDC and local health departments.</p>
